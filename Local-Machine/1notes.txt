Try to make a new Angular project with this command:
$ ng new test
You may get an error message saying the file "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system."
Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command so this will not appear anymore:
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine

You will get a bunch of text in the console after the project is created saying:
"warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in src/polyfills.ts. The file will have its original line endings in your working directory"
To stop this happening, enter this command:
$ git config --global core.autocrlf false


Set PowerShell to start in the Desktop directory when you open it.
    -have Powershell pinned to the taskbar
    -right click on Powershell in the taskbar
    -right click on the Windows PowerShell option and click Properties
    -in the Shortcut tab, set the Start in field to: C:\Users\TLuck\Desktop

Finding the Properties option was a bit wonky- I had to do it from the taskbar, not the start menu. This option is better than making a profile file because it will 
open PowerShell in this directory but when I am working in a project in VS code and open a terminal, it will still default into whatever directory that project is.
