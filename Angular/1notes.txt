Angular notes go here!

Getting started
Make sure you have Node and Git installed on your computer
Install the Angular CLI with this command:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli

Create a new project with this command (replace my-project-name with the name you want to use):
$ ng new my-project-name
It will ask if you want to include Angular router in your project and what stylesheet format to use. Then it will 
create a project folder for you. 

Open the new project in vs code and you will see a ton of starter folders and files. Everything we want to use will be in the src > app folder

Open a terminal in vs code and run this command to start a local server:
$ ng serve
This will start a local server on port 4200, click the link in the console to open the project in a browser: http://localhost:4200/

The page that loads is all the starter stuff they put in app.component.html
Delete everything in this file, add something like:
<h1>Hello World</h1>
save the file and see how it updates in the browser. 

You now have an Angular project up and running.
