Angular notes go here!

Getting started
Make sure you have Node and Git installed on your computer
Install the Angular CLI with this command:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli

Create a new project with this command (replace my-project-name with the name you want to use):
$ ng new my-project-name
It will ask if you want to include Angular router in your project and what stylesheet format to use. Then it will 
create a project folder for you. 

If doing this for the first time on a new computer:
You may get an error message saying the file "cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system."
Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command so this will not appear anymore:
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine

You may get a bunch of text in the console after the project is created saying:
"warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in src/polyfills.ts. The file will have its original line endings in your working directory"
To stop this happening, enter this command:
$ git config --global core.autocrlf false



Open the new project in vs code and you will see a ton of starter folders and files. Everything we want to use will be in the src > app folder

Open a terminal in vs code and run this command to start a local server:
$ ng serve -o
This will start a local server on port 4200. The -o flag will automatically open this project in your default browser. 

The page that loads is all the starter stuff they put in app.component.html
Delete everything in this file, add something like:
<h1>Hello World</h1>
save the file and see how it updates in the browser. 

You now have an Angular project up and running.
