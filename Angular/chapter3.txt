1. Create a new component and display it on the page.


2. In the new component class, give it a string property and assign it a value. Then use interpolation to display it in the template. 


3. Use proptery binding to set the innerText property and display the property in the template this way. 


4. In the stylesheet, make a class called 'red' that turns the font color to red. In the component class, add a boolean property called 'isRed' and set it to true. In the template 
use style binding to add this class to the text being displayed if the isRed property is true.
