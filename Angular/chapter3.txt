1. Create a new component and display it on the page.


2. In the new component class, give it a string property and assign it a value. Then use interpolation to display it in the template. 


3. Use proptery binding to set the innerText property and display the property in the template this way. 


4. In the stylesheet, make a class called 'red' that turns the font color to red. In the component class, add a boolean property 
called 'isRed' and set it to true. In the template use class binding to add this class to the text being displayed if the isRed 
property is true. 


5. Create two more styles in the stylesheet- one to change the font weight and one to change the font size. In the class, create 
a property that is an array of strings with the class names and in the template use class binding to display all three styles. 


6. Change the class property from an array of strings to an object with key value pairs for each class name that is a boolean value. 
See how they turn on or off as you change the values from true to false. 


7. Create a method in the class that logs a message to the console. Then in the template, create a button that calls this method 
when it is clicked.
